<h1>Study Hub</h1>
Study Hub is a web-based study group web app developed as a semester project during our second year of university. The system is designed to help students organize and manage their studies more effectively, while also demonstrating our team's skills in full-stack web development.<br>

Design and User Interface <br>
The project features a clean, modern, and consistent design implemented using CSS. Special attention was given to creating a user-friendly interface that is both responsive and visually appealing. Consistent color schemes, intuitive layouts, and responsive components ensure the system works well across various devices.

Technologies Used
The project is built using a combination of the following technologies:

HTML – for structuring web content

CSS – for styling and responsive design

JavaScript – for client-side interactivity

PHP – for server-side processing

MySQL – for data storage and management
